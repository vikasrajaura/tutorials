JMS (Java Message Service): 
	- is an API that provides the facility to create, send and read messages.
	- It provides loosely coupled, reliable and asynchronous communication.
	- JMS is also known as a messaging service. 
	- JMS is mainly used to send and receive message from one application to another.
	
Advantage of JMS:
	1) Asynchronous: To receive the message, client is not required to send request. Message will arrive automatically to the client.
	2) Reliable: It provides assurance that message is delivered.
	

There are two types of messaging domains in JMS:
Point-to-Point Messaging Domain:
	- In PTP model, one message is delivered to one receiver only. Here, Queue is used as a message oriented middleware (MOM).
	- The Queue is responsible to hold the message until receiver is ready.
	- In PTP model, there is no timing dependency between sender and receiver.
Publisher/Subscriber Messaging Domain:
	- In Pub/Sub model, one message is delivered to all the subscribers. It is like broadcasting. 
	- Here, Topic is used as a message oriented middleware that is responsible to hold and deliver messages.
	- In PTP model, there is timing dependency between publisher and subscriber.
